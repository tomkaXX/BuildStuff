## Workshop Overview

Recent advancements in drone and satellite technology have made high-resolution geospatial data more accessible and affordable. This workshop provides hands-on training on an open-source platform for processing and analyzing drone data, covering both the basics and advanced techniques in drone and satellite data integration. Participants will work with powerful Python tools, including `Geemap` and `Leafmap`, to search, visualize, and analyze geospatial data in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Data Description
The workshop includes sample data collected over several flights using various sensors and overlapping parameters. Attendees will learn how to process data from RGB, LiDAR, and multispectral sensors to create orthomosaics, point clouds, and DSM products. The data below provides key details for each flight conducted.
