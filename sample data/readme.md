# File formats 
- **Orthophoto (Orthophotograph)**
  An orthophoto is an aerial photograph that has been geometrically corrected, or "orthorectified," to ensure that the scale is uniform throughout the image. This means that distances measured on the photo are accurate, just like on a map. It's essentially a photo that has been adjusted to remove distortions caused by the camera angle or terrain.
Why it's used: These images are used for mapping and analysis because they can represent real-world features accurately, such as roads, buildings, or land use.

-  **Multispectral**
Multispectral data refers to images that capture information from multiple bands of light, including visible light (like red, green, and blue) as well as non-visible bands like infrared.
Why it's used: By using different bands, multispectral images allow us to see things that are not visible to the human eye, such as heat signatures or plant health. It's often used in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and land-use planning.

- **Point Cloud**
 A point cloud is a collection of data points in 3D space, usually generated by 3D scanning techniques like LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) or photogrammetry. Each point represents a location in space and typically contains 3D coordinates (X, Y, and Z).
Why it's used: Point clouds are used to create 3D models of objects or environments. They are useful in fields like architecture, construction, and topographic mapping. The data points are processed into 3D models that can be analyzed for things like terrain, structures, and vegetation.

- **DSM (Digital Surface Model)**
  A DSM is a 3D representation of the Earth's surface that includes all the objects on it, like buildings, trees, and other structures. It shows the elevation of the highest points on the surface, including objects like rooftops and vegetation.
Why it's used: DSMs are often used in urban planning, flood modeling, and other applications that need to understand the surface features and how they interact with the environment (like how buildings might affect the flow of water during a storm).

In summary, these files are essential for capturing, analyzing, and modeling the physical world, from detailed maps (orthophotos) to 3D models (point clouds, DSMs), and multispectral imagery used for environmental monitoring.
